### What is in-place algorithm?

> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm):  
> In computer science, an **in-place algorithm** is an algorithm which transforms input using no auxiliary data structure.

let's see it in an example:

```js
const sampleArray = [1, 2, 3]

function multiplyArrayByTwo(array) {
  array.forEach((number, index) => {
    array[index] = number * 2
  })
  return array
}

const result = multiplyArrayByTwo(sampleArray)

console.log(result) // 2,4,6
console.log(sampleArray) // 2,4,6
```

We didn't use any additional data structures to modify the array.
We also see that the **original array was mutated**.
In fact, we don’t need to return the result, we can continue to use the modified sampleArray.
If we will run the function one time, the result will be `[4,8,12]`.

### What is out-of-place algorithm?

Now let's see out-of-place example, we will use map method for that.

```js
const sampleArray = [1, 2, 3]

function multiplayArrayByTwo(array) {
  const modifiedArray = array.map(number => {
    return number * 2
  })
  return modifiedArray
}

const result = multiplayArrayByTwo(sampleArray)

console.log(result) // 2,4,6
console.log(sampleArray) // 1,2,3
```

Now we using a map method to iterate and create a new array.
We use more memory, but the **original array remains the same**. If we will run this function again result and sampleArray will remain the same.

### Which is better?

It depends. Usually, you want to stick with **out-of-place** functions, because it's easier to manage.
But when you have limited memory, you should choose **in-place** function.
