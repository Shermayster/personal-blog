Here's a final result what we want to build:

let's break it into simple steppes:

    1. Create basic image upload with native html input

Let's create a component 'UploadImage'

```javascript
import React from "react"
export function ImageUpload() {
  return <section></section>
}
```

It's not doing much, let add input type="file" to it
