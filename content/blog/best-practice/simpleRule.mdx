## Managing Complexity

One of the hardest responsibilities as a developer is managing complexity. You start a new project with fresh codebase, but after a few months things getting more complex. Your code becomes harder to read, you have unnecessary abstractions and bugs take longer to fix. Sounds familiar?
To solve this problem, I have a few simple rules that help me manage complexity of a codebase.
One of them is:

## **NO NESTED 'IF' STATEMENT**

Why it's important?

We read code more than writing it. We need to optimize our future experience. It should take no longer than 3 seconds to understand what function does. Nested 'if' statement usually means that function is doing more than one thing and will require much more time for understanding.
What should I do instead?

Stick to the rule: **'should do only one thing.'** From a name of a function, it should be clear what it should do. Try to explain everything that a function does with name of the function. If you need to add ‘and’ word, it means you violating the rule. In most case wrapping nested if statement with a function can solve the problem. It’s ok to use function to call several other functions.
It may seem like unnecessary overhead and maybe it is in some cases, but think about future self or other developer. You need to implement a feature or solve a bug; how frustrating is to waste time on understanding unrelated code? You want to move fast, so optimize your code for scanning.
