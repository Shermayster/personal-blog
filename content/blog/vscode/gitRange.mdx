For example we have this:

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const add2 = b => sum(2, b)
```

And we want to commit the code, but with two separate commit. How we can do it in VSCode?
First click on Source Control icon. Then on the right side you will see thee dots menu button, click on it. It will open range commit options.
Choose an option **Stage Selected Ranges**.
Now you can select, what you want to commit. Write the commit message and that's it!
