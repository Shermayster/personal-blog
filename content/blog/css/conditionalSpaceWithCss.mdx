description: add spacing with dynamic element

Sometime we need to add conditionally dynamic text at the end of a sentence and the problem that dynamic text doesn't have spacing before it.
For example:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/cocky-rgb-l6edh?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview"
  style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  title="cocky-rgb-l6edh"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

We can add another element with spacing or add extra space at the start of the conditional element. Both of them is not very good solutions. We can try to solve it with CSS.
Situation that we want to add conditionally an element at the end of sentence. The problem is that element doesn't have a space and we need to add conditionally.
We can do it with JavaScript, or we can try to solve it with CSS.
JavaScript is most expensive resource in your app. If something can be solved with html or css you should do it.
More elegant solution.

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/epic-kilby-hhp2o?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  title="epic-kilby-hhp2o"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>
